# Kviss

Welcome to our New-Years quiz App, where you can create your own quiz with an interactive scoreboard.

Stack includes Vue3 and Typescript, built with Vite. Still very much WIP, current version was built in about one hour just before the guests arrived :sweat-smile: 

## Use the App

Currently, the app is only to be run locally, where you have to type in your questions and team names. Do not reload the page, your state will disappear.

### Things to edit before running

- const `questions` in `Questions.vue`. Fill in your own questions and answers.
- const `teams` in `CounterView.vue`. Fill in the names of your teams.
